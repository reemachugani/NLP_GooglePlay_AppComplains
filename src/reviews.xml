    <review>Samsung S3 (no notification beside whatsapp icon) How do I achieve icon notification? ? I.e. A number beside the icon to show u the number of new messages u received. Currently whenever I looked at the icon it shows no number beside n I always thought there is no new msg when there is. There are icon notification for apps like LINE and FB, I don't see why Whatsapp doesn't have? Is it just my phone or all androids' the same? Somebody please advice. I been missing out lots of text because of this notification issue. Thanks. Full Review</review>

    <review>Suggestions Here's a few tips to make Whatsapp even better...make it possible for android users to hide their online status rather than iPhone users alone... Add more Smileys or change them up plzzzz, these ones are rather tired now ... And plzz create an update that users are allowed to customize the look of their Whatsapp, that way they won't have to run off with whatsapp+, which I myself use cause it's more fun... Thank you and I hope u really take my suggestions into consideration :) Full Review</review>

    <review>Too good to be true! Whatsapp is the best messaging app ever I've been using it for 3 years now Unlike other messaging apps that have been coming up it does not bore me at all! But there is one limitation....... The videos cannot be more than 16 mb :-( Even though I gave 5 stars I would like you to make this change ASAP (Please increase the size of the video that can be sent) Grazie :-D Full Review</review>

    <review>Facing some problems with the app. I can't view display picture of a friend of mine. When I try to open his new pic and by open I mean try to view it in full screen, it keeps on opening the old pic. Although during chat I can see his new pic in small size in the chat screen. The error that it gives is, unable to update profile picture, try again later. The other problem that I am facing is that I sometimes can't see status of that friend of mine and the last time he was on-line. I hope you guys will help me with this problem of mine.
