    <review>Samsung S3 (no notification beside whatsapp icon) How do I achieve icon notification? ? I.e. A number beside the icon to show u the number of new messages u received. Currently whenever I looked at the icon it shows no number beside n I always thought there is no new msg when there is. There are icon notification for apps like LINE and FB, I don't see why Whatsapp doesn't have? Is it just my phone or all androids' the same? Somebody please advice. I been missing out lots of text because of this notification issue. Thanks. Full Review</review>

    <review>Suggestions Here's a few tips to make Whatsapp even better...make it possible for android users to hide their online status rather than iPhone users alone... Add more Smileys or change them up plzzzz, these ones are rather tired now ... And plzz create an update that users are allowed to customize the look of their Whatsapp, that way they won't have to run off with whatsapp+, which I myself use cause it's more fun... Thank you and I hope u really take my suggestions into consideration :) Full Review</review>

The videos cannot be more than 16 mb :-( Even though I gave 5 stars I would like you to make this change ASAP (Please increase the size of the video that can be sent) Grazie :-D Full Review</review>

    <review>Facing some problems with the app. I can't view display picture of a friend of mine. When I try to open his new pic and by open I mean try to view it in full screen, it keeps on opening the old pic. Although during chat I can see his new pic in small size in the chat screen. The error that it gives is, unable to update profile picture, try again later. The other problem that I am facing is that I sometimes can't see status of that friend of mine and the last time he was on-line. I hope you guys will help me with this problem of mine.

    <review>DESERVES UNINSTALL?? I marked my Wifi as a 'Mobile Hotspot' so that, not much background data happens in silent, plus my isp/telco requires additional pseudo-login. Apparently Whatsapp don't like that, and always popping up asking me to 'forget' network. What's up with that? Now that Line, WeChat, Kakao already better, more features and free, I guess it's time to move on. Come on, free for iOS but charge Android users? I can pay but I'm guessing lots of others (my peers are 95% droids) won't or can't, so no point for me to pay. Full Review</review>

Other than that this app is absolutely amazing, really is fantastic. Hope you guys can increase the MB for video's. Full Review</review>

    <review>Good Everything is fine but what I think you could make it better. Give more customization to the graphical interface of the chat window and get the look more attractive and you should "add" an option to send any type of files like doc, pdf, xls, ppt, zip, etc. If you add these things, then I think people would love whatsapp more than they do now and gonna beat other messaging apps. I hope you do read my suggestions and try to implement it. Full Review</review>

    <review>Almost perfect!!! I wouldn't complain of anything else with this app except for the fact that I can't pay through my mobile bills, not everyone using a smartphone have a credit card... Google should also consider using mobile bills as credits at equivalent rates for buying apps on Google play cause teenagers ain't allowed to get credit cards of our own in my country. I would be very happy if whatsapp can implement this first, then Google would learn from them...:p Very good app! High 5! Full Review</review>

    <review>Last update, delete and copy UI has been moved to top. Well,I hv been using it since last one year. The new tap n hold to prompt the copy, delete and forward action, now does the same with beautiful arrangment of icon, but the user has to leave his comfortable device holding palm position, and then it makes it more painful when forward option comes on top area of the messenger and paste option is at bottom.. I think what's app totally ignored the UEx. too much of experiment. I suggest to quickly work on this. Full Review</review>

    <review>Great app, but latest update is redundant. Great app, but very disappointed with the latest update. Voice feature was added, but is redundant. The point of Whatsapp is to send TEXT msgs, otherwise we have something called a "PHONE" for voice communication. (Yes, the object you've been using Whatsapp on is called a "Phone"). Instead, I rather have them spend their resources on giving some customization abilities, such as different font colors, different conversation bubble colors, etc. Whatsapp currently looks like my Android stock text messaging app, and there's no way to change it.

Plus it would be nice if the app was fully free and you didnt have to buy it after a year But I do use this very often to message my friend as it is far cheaper than plain texting xx Full Review</review>

    <review>Great app so far! Whatsapp developers should work on a few points for this app: 1- Enable a button to turn on/off time stamp or last seen. 2-Increase or remove the limit for videos and pictures you can send through it. 3- Enable accept or decline friend requests from people not in your contact list. I will come uo with some other ideas, but so far, I think lots of people are expecting that. Full Review</review>

    <review>Was brilliant until.... They decided to start charging for the app after the first year. This isnt fair it's the only way I can keep in contact with some people. I have been told about tango and they include free calls. Much better. Keep it free and you will keep loyalty otherwise lots will leave. Esp now as most people don't have a lot of money any more with the rising prices. I have 6 months left until it expired but my friend have a couple of weeks some only days so they have started using other services so will I soon. Full Review</review>

Takes bout half hr to an hr to send. Then the same amount of time to receive it. &amp; then it only allows 8 secs of the vid to be shown. U cant send vids that play any longer then 8secs. Whats the point in that? Whats point in having that feature if thats all it will do as im sure im not the only 1 to think this. If you can fix this i will rate 5stars:) Full Review</review>

    <review>I'd like you to adapt a version to HTC Sense The thing is, that HTC Sense allows me to navigate the different apps, in a very cool way. I can switch from a main screen to another one with just a swipe, just like a book page. I'd love that the app was able to do that; like being in the main screen that is the Chats screen, swipe it to the left to go to Contacts and then another swipe to get to the Settings menu. This is just a suggestion and a really personal wish. Everything else is just amazing and very well done. Congratulations for the nice app Full Review</review>

So if someone posts something unsuitable or by accident it can be deleted. Grouped contacts would be an added bonus. Should be able to: 1) forward content to more than one contact at a time - seems to have it, but doesn't work on s3 or note 2, not sure about other devices. 2) forward/rewind or a seek bar for audio player.

It can allow you to share almost everything through messaging and that to also at such cheap and low rate. This application is a must have on every phone. The developers have attained a high standard of classiness that is not available on any other application these days. It would have been more helpful if it even would have features like voice calling. Overall a full 5 star application. Full Review</review>

    <review>Awfull onboarding ux Is this verification process a joke? You should pull-in users, not keep them out! 1st, your app fails auto-verifying me via sms (i got the sms, app clueless). Next - it decides my number is wrong so it won't call me. Like I don't know my own number! Kudos on the awfull experience your app offers at the very begining! Full Review</review>

    <review>Best Messenger Ever Seen!!! Lighting fast and reliable, no need of worrying or retrying the send action if while sending a message, network goes off. That's the best feature I found out. Moreover, you can share thing in a fraction of second unlike the facebook messenger, that requires the message to be resent if no network is available and cover a lage area over your RAM. WhatsApp, simply, IS THE BEST...!!! Full Review</review>

    <review>Excellant Its a very good app for messenging and group chatting with my friends! I have many different groups of friends and using this enables us to keep in contact for meetings, outings or random ...mass spamming. Problem is, the app lags sometimes and i am forced to close it. It gets irritating if its in the middle of a conversation. Sometimes I have to restart my phone. Not sure if its bcos of the memory or my phone. But other than that, this app is wonderful! keep it up! Full Review</review>

    <review>Great App, has basically replaced texting for me and my friends! I got this app because my friends all had it and I decided to see what it was all about. It's a fantastic messaging service, and the group chat function is so cool- my friends and I are always on it! I rarely use texting now! I love all the emoticons and the ways of sending audio, video, images and links. The only thing is sometimes the keyboard freezes and it doesnt allow me to type for a bit, and the images my friends send save immediately onto my phone, which can be annoying as i have to delete lots.

    <review>Liars Good app, but the "No Hidden Cost" thing is wrong. After one year you start getting prompts to annually pay for the app. Its only $1 but what bothers me is the fact that they lie about it. There are also bugs where I do not receive notifications of new messages, and the alerts either disappear, or never show up in my notifications bar. It works, and its very efficient but they have balls asking me for money while my friends are getting mad at me because they think they're being ignored. Full Review</review>

Old cock: 50 meters run. From here to that tree. But due to my age, I hope you allow me to start off the first 10 meters. Young cock: No problem ! We will compete tomorrow morning. Confidently, the following morning, the Young cock allows the Old cock to start off &amp; when the Old cock crosses the 10 meters mark the Young cock chases him with all his might. Soon enough, he was behind the Old cock back in a matter of seconds. Suddenly, Bang.....! Before he could overtake the old cock, he was shot dead by the farmer, who cursed, .. .. .. .. .. .. "Hell !!

    <review>A suggestion? I've been using whatapp for so long that it is rare for anyone to literally send me a text! However, when it comes to group whatapp, I can't identify which group is messaging me and keep having to open the app just to find out. It'll be nice if we can personalize our whatapp group notification (each group having its own tone). Thanks:) Full Review</review>

    <review>Irritating Voice messg delay and vibration Whenever I send a single-letter reply such as K,G, M etc or a single smiley and quickly tap on "Send" button it actually vibrates and makes an irritating loud beep stating that "tap and hold to send voice message". Please fix that delay when quick replying back, otherwise fantastic app.!! Full Review</review>

    <review>Good Idea, but too much basics mssing What I like: (1.) Realtime exchange of text/multimedia messages vs. SMS (2.) You know when messages reach/are read (3.) You send the chat history to email for archiving ==What I do not like== (A.) you cannot switch off ONLINE status (I do not want to be chased and told, "hey you were online, you read it, you didn't respond to my text, I lost 100 EUR because of that...."). Why only apple app has this feature (I was told)? (B.) that you cannot switch the keyboard language based on the chat partner. I am constantly switching from English to German and vice-versa. (C.) the many incoming-sounds. If friends (?) fire 5 messages in 10 seconds, why does WA fire a sound for each? And while typing, I think still the sound is firing. We need to have more control, on how many notification sounds shall occur. How about Once per n minutes also option to make vibration for all other incoming text until next main sound? Any other suggestions? (D.) Night time should be able to block, on cell-phone level (block notifications), but within WA. "Do not disturb" sign? (F.) why not Auto responders, also in case of D. when I want to block a time-slot, e.g. night time?? Full Review</review>

    <review>Why the need to pay? I was a commited whatsapp user until I realised you have to pay after the first year. Then I upgraded to an iphone and it wasnt free AT ALL. I ended up buying against my will. It is a fab app but I stumbled upon Viber which is like this but better. You can call over wifi too - unlike this app. Sorry guys but youve lost a customer to Viber because of these two things. Being forced to buy the app and not being able to make calls with it. Change this and I will return - and more importantly recommend it :-) Full Review</review>

Ability to communicate where there is no network, but have internet access is brilliant. Highly recommend it to anyone in jobs in remote areas away from home. Full Review</review>

Now another problem appeared-i need to update this application,but my phone shows that there no space on phone,but i have. Update is only 8mb and there is 28 free mb space in my phone. How comes it can't be still installed? P.S. If you will not make Whatsapp messenger movable to SD card-I will stop using it! And many people will do it. Impossible to use it because of it's huge Mb updates Full Review</review>

    <review>Media stored as app data - not an improvement Previously, once unwanted media (photos, videos) were deleted from the phone's photo gallery, they would be permanently deleted. Recently, something changed and whatsapp stores media within the app data. Even after I have deleted the files from my phone's photo gallery, they still reside in whatsapp with no way to delete. As a result, my whatsapp app data size has ballooned and caused my phone to run out of storage space. This needs to be fixed ASAP! Thanks! Full Review</review>
